# IMDB-Total-Watching-Time

This program calculates total time spent on watching movies and tv-series based on personal imdb rating lists. There are two options for calculation. One is to calculate only movies which is a fast method because only rating pages are requested and processed. The other option is to calculate both movies and tv-series which is slow because type of the title and number of episodes  are not presented on rating list and  due to that all rated movies and series page are visited one by one and type of title and number of episodes are gathered.
